This repository contains a Python package with several Manubot-related utilities, as described in the usage section below. Package documentation is available at https://manubot.github.io/manubot (auto-generated from the Python source code). The manubot cite command-line interface retrieves and formats bibliographic metadata for user-supplied persistent identifiers like DOIs or PubMed IDs. The manubot process command-line interface prepares scholarly manuscripts for Pandoc consumption. The manubot process command is used by Manubot manuscripts, which are based off the Rootstock template , to automate several aspects of manuscript generation. The manubot ai-revision command is used to automatically revise a manuscript based on a set of AI-generated suggestions. See Rootstock's manuscript usage guide for more information. Note: If you want to experience Manubot by editing an existing manuscript, see https://github.com/manubot/try-manubot . If you want to create a new manuscript, see https://github.com/manubot/rootstock .

Slochower, Dongbo Hu, Venkat S. Malladi, Casey S. Greene, Anthony Gitter PLOS Computational Biology (2019-06-24) https://doi.org/c7np DOI: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128 \u00b7 PMID: 31233491 \u00b7 PMCID: PMC6611653 The Manubot version of this manuscript is available at https://greenelab.github.io/meta-review/ . Installation If you are using the manubot Python package as part of a manuscript repository, installation of this package is handled though the Rootstock's environment specification . For other use cases, this package can be installed via pip . Install the latest release version from PyPI : pip install --upgrade manubot Or install from the source code on GitHub , using the version specified by a commit hash: COMMIT = d2160151e52750895571079a6e257beb6e0b1278 pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/manubot/manubot@ $COMMIT The --upgrade argument ensures pip updates an existing manubot installation if present. Some functions in this package require Pandoc , which must be installed separately on the system. The pandoc-manubot-cite filter depends on Pandoc as well as panflute (a Python package). Users must install a compatible version of panflute based on their Pandoc version. For example, on a system with Pandoc 2.9, install the appropriate panflute like pip install panflute==1.12.5 . Usage Installing the python package creates the manubot command line program. Here is the usage information as per manubot --help : usage : manubot [- h ] [-- version ] { process , cite , webpage , ai - revision } ... Manubot : the manuscript bot for scholarly writing options : - h , -- help show this help message and exit -- version show program ' s version number and exit subcommands : All operations are done through subcommands : { process , cite , webpage , ai - revision } process process manuscript content cite citekey to CSL JSON command line utility webpage deploy Manubot outputs to a webpage directory tree ai - revision revise manuscript content with language models Note that all operations are done through the following sub-commands. Process The manubot process program is the primary interface to using Manubot. There are two required arguments: --content-directory and --output-directory , which specify the respective paths to the content and output directories. The content directory stores the manuscript source files. Files generated by Manubot are saved to the output directory. One common setup is to create a directory for a manuscript that contains both the content and output directory. Under this setup, you can run the Manubot using: manubot process \\ --skip-citations \\ --content-directory = content \\ --output-directory = output See manubot process --help for documentation of all command line arguments: usage : manubot process [- h ] -- content - directory CONTENT_DIRECTORY -- output - directory OUTPUT_DIRECTORY [-- template - variables - path TEMPLATE_VARIABLES_PATH ] -- skip - citations [-- cache - directory CACHE_DIRECTORY ] [-- clear - requests - cache ] [-- skip - remote ] [-- log - level { DEBUG , INFO , WARNING , ERROR , CRITICAL } ] Process manuscript content to create outputs for Pandoc consumption . Performs bibliographic processing and templating . options : - h , -- help show this help message and exit -- content - directory CONTENT_DIRECTORY Directory where manuscript content files are located . -- output - directory OUTPUT_DIRECTORY Directory to output files generated by this script . -- template - variables - path TEMPLATE_VARIABLES_PATH Path or URL of a file containing template variables for jinja2 . Serialization format is inferred from the file extension , with support for JSON , YAML , and TOML . If the format cannot be detected , the parser assumes JSON . Specify this argument multiple times to read multiple files . Variables can be applied to a namespace ( i . e . stored under a dictionary key ) like ` -- template - variables - path = namespace = path_or_url ` . Namespaces must match the regex ` [ a - zA - Z_ ][ a - zA - Z0 - 9 _ ]* ` . -- skip - citations Skip citation and reference processing . Support for citation and reference processing has been moved from ` manubot process ` to the pandoc - manubot - cite filter . Therefore this argument is now required . If citation - tags . tsv is found in content , these tags will be inserted in the markdown output using the reference - link syntax for citekey aliases . Appends content / manual - references * . * paths to Pandoc 's metadata . bibliography field . -- cache - directory CACHE_DIRECTORY Custom cache directory . If not specified , caches to output - directory . -- clear - requests - cache -- skip - remote Do not add the rootstock repository to the local git repository remotes . -- log - level { DEBUG , INFO , WARNING , ERROR , CRITICAL } Set the logging level for stderr logging Manual references Manubot has the ability to rely on user-provided reference metadata rather than generating it. manubot process searches the content directory for files containing manually-provided reference metadata that match the glob manual-references*.* . These files are stored in the Pandoc metadata bibliography field, such that they can be loaded by pandoc-manubot-cite . Cite manubot cite is a command line utility to produce bibliographic metadata for citation keys. The utility either outputs metadata as CSL JSON items or produces formatted references if --render . Citation keys should be in the format prefix:accession . For example, the following example generates Markdown-formatted references for four persistent identifiers: manubot cite --format = markdown \\ doi:10.1098/rsif.2017.0387 pubmed:29424689 pmc:PMC5640425 arxiv:1806.05726 The following terminal recording demonstrates the main features of manubot cite (for a slightly outdated version): Additional usage information is available from manubot cite --help : usage : manubot cite [ - h ] [ -- output OUTPUT ] [ -- format { csljson , cslyaml , plain , markdown , docx , html , jats } | -- yml | -- txt | -- md ] [ -- csl CSL ] [ -- bibliography BIBLIOGRAPHY ] [ -- no - infer - prefix ] [ -- allow - invalid - csl - data ] [ -- log - level { DEBUG , INFO , WARNING , ERROR , CRITICAL }] citekeys [ citekeys ... ] Generate bibliographic metadata in CSL JSON format for one or more citation keys .

Otherwise , default to csljson . -- yml Short for -- format = cslyaml . -- txt Short for -- format = plain . -- md Short for -- format = markdown . -- csl CSL URL or path with CSL XML style used to style references ( i . e . Pandoc 's --csl option). Defaults to Manubot 's style. -- bibliography BIBLIOGRAPHY File to read manual reference metadata . Specify multiple times to load multiple files . Similar to pandoc -- bibliography . -- no - infer - prefix Do not attempt to infer the prefix for citekeys without a known prefix . -- allow - invalid - csl - data Allow CSL Items that do not conform to the JSON Schema . Skips CSL pruning . -- log - level { DEBUG , INFO , WARNING , ERROR , CRITICAL } Set the logging level for stderr logging Pandoc filter This package creates the pandoc-manubot-cite Pandoc filter, providing access to Manubot's cite-by-ID functionality from within a Pandoc workflow. Options are set via Pandoc metadata fields listed in the docs . usage : pandoc - manubot - cite [ -h ] [ --input [INPUT ] ] [ --output [OUTPUT ] ] target_format Pandoc filter for citation by persistent identifier . Filters are command - line programs that read and write a JSON - encoded abstract syntax tree for Pandoc . Unless you are debugging , run this filter as part of a pandoc command by specifying -- filter = pandoc - manubot - cite . positional arguments : target_format output format of the pandoc command , as per Pandoc ' s -- to option options : - h , -- help show this help message and exit -- input [ INPUT ] path read JSON input ( defaults to stdin ) --output [OUTPUT] path to write JSON output (defaults to stdout) Other Pandoc filters exist that do something similar: pandoc-url2cite , pandoc-url2cite-hs , & pwcite . Currently, pandoc-manubot-cite supports the most types of persistent identifiers. We're interested in creating as much compatibility as possible between these filters and their syntaxes. Manual references Manual references are loaded from the references and bibliography Pandoc metadata fields. If a manual reference filename ends with .json or .yaml , it's assumed to contain CSL Data (i.e. Citation Style Language JSON). Otherwise, the format is inferred from the extension and converted to CSL JSON using the pandoc-citeproc --bib2json utility . The standard citation key for manual references is inferred from the CSL JSON id or note field. When no prefix is provided, such as doi: , url: , or raw: , a raw: prefix is automatically added. If multiple manual reference files load metadata for the same standard citation id , precedence is assigned according to descending filename order. Webpage The manubot webpage command populates a webpage directory with Manubot output files. usage : manubot webpage [- h ] [-- checkout [ CHECKOUT ]] [-- version VERSION ] [-- timestamp ] [-- no - ots - cache | -- ots - cache OTS_CACHE ] [-- log - level { DEBUG , INFO , WARNING , ERROR , CRITICAL }] Update the webpage directory tree with Manubot output files . This command should be run from the root directory of a Manubot manuscript that follows the Rootstock layout , containing ` output ` and ` webpage ` directories . HTML and PDF outputs are copied to the webpage directory , which is structured as static source files for website hosting . options : - h , -- help show this help message and exit -- checkout [ CHECKOUT ] branch to checkout / v directory contents from . For example , -- checkout = upstream / gh - pages . -- checkout is equivalent to -- checkout = gh - pages . If -- checkout is ommitted , no checkout is performed . -- version VERSION Used to create webpage /v/ { version } directory . Generally a commit hash , tag , or 'local' . When omitted , version defaults to the commit hash on CI builds and 'local' elsewhere . -- timestamp timestamp versioned manuscripts in webpage / v using OpenTimestamps . Specify this flag to create timestamps for the current HTML and PDF outputs and upgrade any timestamps from past manuscript versions . -- no - ots - cache disable the timestamp cache . -- ots - cache OTS_CACHE location for the timestamp cache ( default : ci /cache/ ots ). -- log - level { DEBUG , INFO , WARNING , ERROR , CRITICAL } Set the logging level for stderr logging AI-assisted academic authoring The manubot ai-revision command uses large language models from OpenAI to automatically revise a manuscript and suggest text improvements. usage : manubot ai - revision [- h ] -- content - directory CONTENT_DIRECTORY [-- config - directory CONFIG_DIRECTORY ] [-- model - type MODEL_TYPE ] [-- model - kwargs key = value [ key = value ...]] [-- log - level { DEBUG , INFO , WARNING , ERROR , CRITICAL }] Revise manuscript content using AI models to suggest text improvements . options : - h , -- help show this help message and exit -- content - directory CONTENT_DIRECTORY Directory where manuscript content files are located . -- config - directory CONFIG_DIRECTORY Directory where AI revision configuration files are located .

ManuscriptRevisionModel -- model - kwargs key = value [ key = value ...] Keyword arguments for the revision model (-- model - type ), with format key = value . -- log - level { DEBUG , INFO , WARNING , ERROR , CRITICAL } Set the logging level for stderr logging The usual call is: manubot ai-revision --content-directory content/ The parameters --model-type and --model-kwargs are used for debugging purposes. For example, since the tool splits the text into paragraphs, you might want to see if paragraphs were detected correctly. The tool incurs a cost when using the OpenAI API, so this could be important to check for text with complicated structure. manubot ai - revision \\ -- content - directory content / \\ -- model - type DummyManuscriptRevisionModel \\ -- model - kwargs add_paragraph_marks = true Development Environment Create a development environment using: conda create --name manubot-dev --channel conda-forge \\ python = 3 .11 pandoc = 2 .11.3.1 conda activate manubot-dev # assumes conda >= 4.4 pip install --editable \".[webpage,dev]\" Commands Below are some common commands used for development.

Additionally, we examine scalability and reconstruction quality in comparison to established learned reconstruction methods in two dimensions for low dose computed tomography on human phantoms.\" ) assert csl_item [ \"abstract\" ] == abstract","title":"test_get_arxiv_csl_item_abstract_whitespace"},{"location":"reference/manubot/cite/tests/test_arxiv/#test_get_arxiv_csl_item_oai","text":"def test_get_arxiv_csl_item_oai ( ) https://export.arxiv.org/oai2?verb=GetRecord&identifier=oai:arXiv.org:1912.04616&metadataPrefix=arXiv View Source def test_get_arxiv_csl_item_oai (): \"\"\" https://export.arxiv.org/oai2?verb=GetRecord&identifier=oai:arXiv.org:1912.04616&metadataPrefix=arXiv \"\"\" csl_item = get_arxiv_csl_item_oai ( \"1912.04616\" ) assert ( csl_item [ \"title\" ] == \"OpenBioLink: A benchmarking framework for large-scale biomedical link prediction\" ) assert csl_item [ \"URL\" ] == \"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04616\" assert csl_item . note_dict [ \"license\" ] assert csl_item [ \"author\" ][ 0 ][ \"family\" ] == \"Breit\"","title":"test_get_arxiv_csl_item_oai"},{"location":"reference/manubot/cite/tests/test_citations/","text":"Module manubot.cite.tests.test_citations View Source import pathlib import pytest from manubot.cite.citations import Citations def test_citations_filter_pandoc_xnos (): input_ids = [ \"fig:pandoc-fignos-key\" , # should filter \"eq:pandoc-eqnos-key\" , # should filter \"tbl:pandoc-tablenos-key\" , # should filter \"sec:pandoc-secnos-key\" , # should filter \"not-pandoc-xnos-key\" , # should keep ] citations = Citations ( input_ids ) citations . filter_pandoc_xnos () assert len ( citations . citekeys ) == 1 assert citations . citekeys [ 0 ] . input_id == \"not-pandoc-xnos-key\" def test_citations_filter_unhandled (): input_ids = [ \"citekey-with-no-prefix\" , \"bad-prefix:citekey\" , \":empty-prefix\" , \"doi:handled-prefix\" , ] citations = Citations ( input_ids ) citations . filter_unhandled () assert len ( citations . citekeys ) == 1 assert citations . citekeys [ 0 ] . input_id == \"doi:handled-prefix\" def test_citations_check_collisions ( caplog ): input_ids = [ \"citekey-1\" , \"citekey-1\" , \"citekey-2\" , \"Citekey-2\" , ] citations = Citations ( input_ids ) citations . check_collisions () assert not caplog . records def test_citations_check_multiple_input_ids ( caplog ): input_ids = [ \"doi:10/b6vnmd\" , \"DOI:10/B6VNMD\" , \"doi:10.1016/s0933-3657(96)00367-3\" , \"ugly-doi-alias\" , \"other-citekey\" , ] citekey_aliases = { \"ugly-doi-alias\" : \"DOI:10.1016/s0933-3657(96)00367-3\" } citations = Citations ( input_ids , citekey_aliases ) citations . check_multiple_input_ids () expected = \"Multiple citekey input_ids refer to the same standard_id doi:10.1016/s0933-3657(96)00367-3:\" \"['doi:10/b6vnmd', 'DOI:10/B6VNMD', 'doi:10.1016/s0933-3657(96)00367-3', 'ugly-doi-alias']\" assert expected in caplog . text def test_citations_citekeys_tsv (): input_ids = [ \"citekey-1\" , \"arXiv:1806.05726v1\" , \"DOI:10.7717/peerj.338\" , \"pmid:29618526\" , ] citations = Citations ( input_ids ) citekeys_tsv = citations . citekeys_tsv assert isinstance ( citekeys_tsv , str ) assert \"arxiv:1806.05726v1\" in citekeys_tsv . splitlines ()[ 2 ] . split ( \" \\t \" ) def test_citations_inspect (): input_ids = [ \"citekey-1\" , # passes inspection \"arXiv:1806.05726v1\" , # passes inspection \"arXiv:bad-id\" , \"DOI:bad-id\" , \"pmid:bad-id\" , \"DOID:not-disease-ontology-id\" , ] citations = Citations ( input_ids ) report = citations . inspect ( log_level = \"INFO\" ) print ( report ) assert len ( report . splitlines ()) == 4 assert \"pmid:bad-id -- PubMed Identifiers should be 1-8 digits\" in report @pytest . mark . parametrize ( \"csl_format\" , [ \"json\" , \"yaml\" ]) def test_citations_csl_serialization ( csl_format ): ccr_dir = pathlib .
